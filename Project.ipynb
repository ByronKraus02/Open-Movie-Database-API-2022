The split function is then called to put the contents of our textfile (which holds all the movies information of which you have searched beforehand) into a list, split by the paramter sent across, which in this case is \"title\". This will put the entirety of each movie's information into each posititon of the list \"information\". It then checks if the movietitle the user searched is already in the textfile, if it is it will display that part of the list, which contains all the information on the movie and will turn the boolean into false, which will stop the program from checking the OMDB for the contents of the movie. If the movie title cannot be found in the textfile, boolean \"check\" will remain True, and the program will check the OMDB for the movie. If the movie doesn't exist, it will return an empty dictionary, and so I use the len() function to check that the movie is on the OMDB, if it exists, it will append to the textfile, using json to dump the contents of the movie information into the textfile, and print the contents of the movie, otherwise it will explain that the movie you have searched for does not exist.

    "When I first began writing this program, I had to do research on what an OMDB is, how it's data is returned and the most effective way to deal with it. I managed to figure out that the data is returned as a dictionary when using the .get() method. Using this method allowed me to find specific information easily, but made putting data into the textfile difficult as it would only put the first part of the dictionary. To counter this problem I imported json and used json.dump() which allowed me to put everything into the textfile. When I tried to retrieve the work from the textfile I thought I would be able to use the same method as normal in terms of using a dictionary search, but it came back as a string. To get around this issue I decided to split the string up by the comma and then search that list for the information I wanted. The next issue I found was that when I looked up a movie, if one didn't exist it would simply return an empty dictionary, which would then result in errors when searching that dictionary for information, I managed to fix this issue by using len() to see if the dictionary is empty or not. Finally I found that many unneccessary errors were caused from incorrect user input, after doing extensive research and trying many different ways of countering the users errors, I decided the best way to deal with it was to limit the user interaction. I did this by importing pyautogui into my program, which allows me to use message boxes and button options instead of being able to write anything to run, this means for yes or no options, buttons can be used instead of the user typing 'Y' or \"Yes\" and so on. The message boxes also look a lot more neat and professional than the message being displayed below the code, especially when markdown's surround the code. I also encountered an error when the user pressed cancel on the buttons as this would return None, which then causes string related errors, to counter this issue I said if the box == None and then gave a message saying they cancelled and moved back."
